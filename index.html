            Many times searching without being able to find you, the twilight would surprise me in the hour of your eyes. <br>
            Many times I forgot you, wanted to forget myself and remember, and remembered I had to forget you,<br>
            thinking of you for the very reason I didn't want to remember you<br>
            - the twilight would surround me at such times, I remember it perfectly.<br>
            I confused you with the twilight confusing myself with you;<br>
            you confused me with the twilight confusing yourself with me,<br>
            and you and I confused ourselves with the twilight which confused you in me and me in you,<br>
            confusing with you what was confused in me to confuse with me what was confused in you.<br>
            And many times in the same person there was a confusion of twilight, you and me,<br>
            and many more each confused with three other distinct persons,<br>
            adding up to nine altogether, which is to say, zero.<br>
            And there was no such person called twilight,<br>
            or, to tell the truth, no person not called twilight,<br>
            except those called you and I, who nevertheless could not keep from calling each other twilight.<br>
